## Machine Learning Project 

Here is what i have done so far:-

1. Created the "venv" environent.
2. Build the Setup.py file
3. Wrote some code for getting the packages setup for the project.
4. Created a src folder.
5. Created project related files(no code yet).
6. Learned and Created basic templates of Exceptions and Logging files    
7. Loaded the Dataset (Students Exam Performance)
8. Split the data into Train/Test.

Here are the some of the logs:
